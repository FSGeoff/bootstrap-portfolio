<!-- # bootstrap-portfolio -->

<!--
Began by creating 3 html files(index.html, contacts.html, portfolio.html) scaffolded them with boiler-plate and connected Bootstrap for CSS and JS.

Added my own stylesheet for each .html page to customize the styling.
Added a universal Navbar to all pages with links to each page.

Used the Bootstrap to format the grids on all pages to match the example provided.

Matched colors, fonts, positioned of images and text, and customized the content to my personal information.
After all pages were visually complete, I went back and added semantic elements and comments to the html and synced the order of my CSS with the corresponding html page.

Also added a sticky footer to each page

To make my code more legible I used a plug-in code formatter
